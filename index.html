            <p>
                I am a student at Iowa State University studying Software Engineering. I am the Vice President and 
                Treasurer of the Google Developer Group, alongside my role of President in Jones House in Eaton Hall.
                The positions allow me to help improve the life of residents of Eaton hall, but also bring outstanding
                developers to intrigued students. I am also excelling in classwork, currently digging into Com S 309, which teaches 
                standard programming practices through a group project.
                <br><br>
                I am excited for what my future holds and would love for you to be a part of it!

                    This project aimed to solve a vetranary medicine issue. I participated in
                    a group of four students to take information from the FDA Greenbook (animal drug database),
                    and make it more easily searchable. This was accomplished and we were awarded
                    <strong>Best Technical Build</strong>.
                    <br>
                    This project utilized React and no back end, so I really have no clue how we won that award.
                    For this being my first hackathon I am proud of my accomplishments.
